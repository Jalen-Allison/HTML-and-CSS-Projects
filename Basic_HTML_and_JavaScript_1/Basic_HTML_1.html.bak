							This is a paragraph for the font assignment. I choose the color green, I hope it 
							works first try. If not, no big deal. I just have look the code over closely and compare and see what I did wrong.
							it's usually just a <u>small</u> error which makes it harder to find. </font></p>

		<p><font color="#DC143C" face="Roboto" size="5">Second paragraph, I'm on the train on the way to work. Its a crisp and foggy Monday morning
								It's <b>quiet</b> on the train today which is good, gives me time to wake up over a period of time 
								rather than having to be alert and attentive to everyone around me. I can see the sunrise peaking through between
								the trees getting glimpses of warmth streaking across my face through the branches. Overall, its been a good train ride so far.
